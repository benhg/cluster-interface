## cluster-interface

Singularity is a containerization platform for isolating job execution environments. 

This is an experiment to attempt to automatically generate, schedule, and run singularity containers for common job patterns on the Lewis and Clark College campus cluster.

This is an independent study by Benjamin Glick (@benhg, glick@lclark.edu), advised by Dr. Jens Mache (jmache@lclark.edu). Please feel free to contact me (Ben) with any questions or suggestions.
